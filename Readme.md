# Quickstart

- Code for the blog post
  [here](https://pd-dev.xyz/blog/why-monads-make-lives-easier)
- Download haskell. Just follow this link
  [here](https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/). I did not have it on my new machine
and I was up and running in 2 minutes.
- Load the test file into the haskell REPL.
    - $ ghci
    - $ :l Test.hs
- Try out the "shoveIt" and "shoveIt2" functions and check the result.
    - $ shoveIt 2
    - $ shoveIt 3
    - $ shoveIt2 5
    - $ shoveIt2 6
